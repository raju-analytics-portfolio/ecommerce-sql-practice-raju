About This Repository:-

This repository is created to track my day-to-day SQL learning journey using a realistic E-commerce dataset.
My goal is to improve SQL skills step-by-step by practicing real-world scenarios such as customer analytics, 
order analysis, product performance, revenue calculations, and more.
